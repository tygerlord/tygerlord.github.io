## *Wave-particle duality*

The particle going faster than light creating an electromagnetic bang elegantly explains the particle wave duality. indeed, we no longer have a strange phenomenon but rather a classic phenomenon, a particle and a well-separated wave.

## *The collapse of the wave function*

If we consider that the wave is due to the exceeding of the light speed by the particle then the collapse of the wave function is explained very well, by the measurement bringing the particle back to the light speed of displacement in time stopping thus generating the wave. Besides, what are we really measuring? the particle, the energy of the wave ? 

## *The absence of mass of the photon*

The absence of mass of the photon is also explained very well in this context, the particle of the photon being no longer in our 'time' it has a zero mass at the moment since it is already no longer there.

## *Dark matter, dark energy*

If we consider particles going beyond the speed of light, we have very real particles as well as an energy of movement that we cannot observe. this corresponds fairly well with what is obtained experimentally.

## *Introducing i into the Schrödinger equation*

The appearance of imaginary numbers in the Schrödinger equation is explained very well if we consider particles going beyond the speed of light and corresponds to the introduction of the location of the particle in space-time, and no longer only in space, at a time t.

## *Pauli's exclusion principle*

Pauli's exclusion principle becomes obvious, two particles cannot be in the same place in space-time, as in our space we cannot put two objects in the same place at the same time.

## *The de Broglie-Bohm theory*

De Broglie imagined a pilot wave in his [pilot wave theory](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/th%c3%a9orie de broglie-bohm). I endorse his arguments, but replacing the pilot wave by pilot particle. it is not a wave which pilots a particle, but a particle which pilots a wave. this particle goes faster than the speed of light which gives it this strange behavior that we observe in quantum physics.


## *Einstein and remote frightening action*

The action at a distance can also be explained by particles going beyond the speed of light being able to influence another more quickly than the return we could have, which would explain why we have this impression of immediate effect at distance which it would break the concept of locality.

## *Quantum eraser*

It is the standard experiment which breaks the locality by putting the consequence before the cause, but with the idea of ​​particle going faster than the light, one returns in the good order the cause precedes the consequence.

This is only a theory and requires further study of the description of the phenomena and their demonstrations.
