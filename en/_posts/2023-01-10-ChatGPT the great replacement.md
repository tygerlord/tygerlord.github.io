# ChatGPT

At the end of 2022 the world has changed, a completely unnoticed revolution for many of us. I think that even specialists are not fully aware of the scope of this innovation. just as gutenbert when he invented the printing press knew how to hold something important, I don't think he could imagine all the changes that his invention would bring about. nor do I speak to you of the 'copyist monks' who still today strive to close their eyes hoping that this is only a nightmare.

this revolution is chatgpt, so I'm not going to explain to you what chatgpt is, as the subject is talked about, you will find many explanations in the media. for my purpose, you just need to know that chatgpt is an artificial intelligence that answers your questions in a way close to a conversation you would have with someone who has read the whole internet.

so how is this revolutionary you will tell me, and well imagine talking to someone with all the knowledge of the internet and able to restore it to you in a conversation. currently, if you have a question, you go to a search engine that provides a set of documents that you must go through to get your answer. well, with such a tool, you no longer need to waste a lot of time browsing, you ask the question and get an answer immediately (or almost, let's not quibble)! I pass over the problems of ethics, relevance and quality of the response and all that is not my point.

even stronger, you can ask chatgpt to do software development, film scripts, articles, which does not fail to worry a lot of creators, and that's where I'm coming from (yes, finally !). will this type of tool make a certain number of trades disappear? obviously yes, that's the meaning of the story and unless you want to repeat the mistakes of the 'copyist monks', it is useless to go against it. First of all, since the dawn of time, we have been moving towards a reduction in effort and we are not complaining about it. who would imagine doing without the wheelbarrow because the wheel made the carriers disappear? then it is not because there is a competitor that your know-how suddenly becomes useless. Finally, it's also a great opportunity to develop new skills and jump a step from developer to product manager or screenwriter to producer, for example. we must not be selfish, when the giant 3d printer capable of printing houses in record time was released, I saw people criticize the disappearance of their know-how, regret noble work, quality etc but these are people who have a house, the others who are waiting welcome the hope of finally being able to find accommodation quickly. with AI algorithms, many people will finally be able to express themselves and we will see new talents, new discoveries, exciting things emerge.

well since everything is fine, why do we worry? it's true that there will be upheavals and that it will upset a lot of people, the problem is to adapt to these upheavals, it takes time. so we don't worry but we prepare anyway, so as not to be taken by surprise. more and more perfected and autonomous, objects will gradually be able to perform increasingly complex human tasks to the point of replacing workers. we must have as our focus a society where humans no longer work to live but eventually to have fun. that's very nice, but how do you concretely go from a society where the humanoid works to a society where the humanoid works without completely blowing up everything? I propose the following idea, today we buy a car to go to work, tomorrow we will buy a robot to do the job. so we can keep a model equivalent to what we know today, a family manager generating a certain amount of values ​​that we choose to use according to our desires and priorities, so we come back to a classic model of functioning of our societies. with this system, you keep exactly the current mode of operation. you are going to tell me that we can currently do that, buy a computer for example and rent its computing power to manufacturers, yes, but then you become an entrepreneur and are no longer an employee, moreover if you do not need more computing power but a bike assembler your investment goes down the drain. for this to work, I think we need on the one hand real humanoid robots (and it's not yet for tomorrow) and on the other hand obviously an evolution of our mentalities.
